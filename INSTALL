To install multifario:

   download the gzipped tar file. If you require another type of file please email the author mhender@us.ibm.com

   extract the files. For example:

          tar -zxf multifario.v0.9g.tar.gz

   run configure

	  aclocal
	  automake
	  autoconf
	  ./configure --with-lapack=dirname1 --with-blas=dirname2

   where dirname1 is the directory in which lib/libpack.a and dirname2 where lib/libblas.a can be found 
   make the libraries and example programs.

	make

   if you want to install the libraries, includes and binaries somewhere else, you can use something like

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

   and then

        make install

   will copy them there. "./configure --help" explains all this. Or just copy the things yourself.
