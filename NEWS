Version v0.9g:    05/1/2009

     We are getting closer to a first official release.

     This new release is a move from autoconf to automake/libtool/autoconf for the installation process. There is also
        a slight change in the directory structure that was required by this move.

     Several minor bugs have been fixed. In MFAlgebraic there was a typo in a call to dgetrs which caused an abend on some platforms.

     Many thanks to Christos Frouzakis for his thorough testing and detailed reports of problems.

  Things that don't work quite right:

        Saving and reading .atlas files is broken. I've been lazy, and haven't been implementing the routines to read and write the
         data from the newer objects. However, the .plotfile does everything I ever used the atlas files for, and are much smaller.

        AUTINTMultifario2d and some of the other AUTO examples are still being debugged. I think I've conviced myself that they're
         really working, but need a little more time. AUTINT uses AUTO itself, so produces auto.* output files. AUTINTMultifario 
         replaces AUTO's control with multifario, and just uses AUTO's boundary value solvers. (so a .plotfile instead of auto.* files)
