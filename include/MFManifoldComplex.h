/* This class is s superclass of Atlas. It represents a Cell Complex whose cells are manifolds (MFAtlas).
 *      The output of a continuation (a connected component) is a manifold complex. k cells are k-manifolds
 *      with boundary. The boundary is a set of k-1 manifolds which are either the intersection of a manifold
 *      with a n-1 manifold (the boundary of the region of interest) or submanifolds of singular points
